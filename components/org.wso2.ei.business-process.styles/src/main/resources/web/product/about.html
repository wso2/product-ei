<h2>About WSO2 Enterprise Integrator - Business Process Profile</h2>
<p>
    WSO2 Enterprise Integrator - Business Process Profile (BPS) is an easy-to-use Open Source Business Process Server that executes business processes written following WS-BPEL and WS-Human Task standards or BPMN(Business Process Modelling Notation) standards. WS-BPEL is the defacto standard for composing multiple synchronous and asynchronous web services into collaborative and transactional process flows which increase the flexibility and agility of your Service Oriented Architecture. WS-Human Task allows people activities to be integrated with business processes. WSO2 BPS is powered by <a href="http://ode.apache.org">Apache ODE</a> and available under <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache Software License v2.0</a>. WSO2 BPS provides a complete Web based graphical console to deploy, manage and monitor business process and process instances. BPMN is a business process modelling language, which has both an XML serialization and a graphical notation. Processes modeled in BPMN can be executed in workflow engines, at the same time understandable to business users. Supporting BPMN (based on <a href="http://activiti.org/">Activiti</a>) in WSO2 BPS allows all WSO2 platform users to benefit from the advantages of a highly expressive workflow language.
</p>
<p>WSO2 Enterprise Integrator - Business Process Profile is developed on top of the revolutionary
   wso2 carbon platform and is based on the OSGi framework to achieve the
   better modularity for your SOA architecture. This also contains a lots of new
   features and many other optional components to customize the behavior of the
   server. Further, if you do not want any of the built in features, you can
   uninstall those features without any trouble. In other words, this ES can be
   customized to your SOA needs.</p>
