# Default list of JAR files that should not be scanned using the JarScanner
# functionality. This is typically used to scan JARs for configuration
# information. JARs that do not contain such information may be excluded from
# the scan to speed up the scanning process. This is the default list. JARs on
# this list are excluded from all scans. The list must be a comma separated list
# of JAR file names.
# The list of JARs to skip may be over-ridden at a Context level for individual
# scan types by configuring a JarScanner with a nested JarScanFilter.
# The JARs listed below include:
# - Tomcat Bootstrap JARs
# - Tomcat API JARs
# - Catalina JARs
# - Jasper JARs
# - Tomcat JARs
# - Common non-Tomcat JARs
# - Test JARs (JUnit, Cobertura and dependencies)
