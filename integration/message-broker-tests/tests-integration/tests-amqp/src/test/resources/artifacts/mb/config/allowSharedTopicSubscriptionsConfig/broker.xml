                  on the node has a clustering mechanism enabled or not. If the node is not configured to join a cluster
                  it will run in HA mode (refer to axis2.xml for more information). If the node can join a cluster it

        standalone - This is the simplest mode a broker can be started. Node will assume datastore is not shared with
                     another node. Therefore it will not try to coordinate with other nodes (possibly non-existent) to
                     provide HA or clustering.
