            <h1>The WSO2 Enterprise Integrator (EI) @product.version@ Released!</h1>

            <p>
                WSO2 EI team is pleased to announce the release of version @product.version@ of
                the Open Source Enterprise Integrator (EI).
            </p>

            <p>
                WSO2 EI is a unified distribution of WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus and
                Data Services Server, which works as a single runtime (Integrator) along with optional runtimes for
                EI Analytics, Business Processor and Message Broker. This product distribution includes a shared
                component directory, with profile-based management capabilities for each runtime.
                WSO2 EI distribution contains another lightweight integration runtime called 'Micro Integrator' that is
                optimized to deploy in containers.
            </p>

            <p>
                WSO2 EI simplifies integration by allowing users to easily configure message routing, message mediation,
                transformation, logging, task scheduling, load balancing, failover routing,
                event brokering etc. Data services and various applications can also be hosted and exposed using WSO2 EI.
                These integration capabilities are further powered by the capabilities of the EI Analytics, Business Processor and Message Broker runtimes.
            </p>
