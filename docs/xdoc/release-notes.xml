            <h1>The WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) 5.0.0 Released!</h1>

            <p>
                WSO2 ESB team is pleased to announce the release of version 5.0.0 of
                the Open Source Enterprise Service Bus (ESB).
            </p>

            <p>
                WSO2 ESB is a fast, lightweight and user friendly open source Enterprise Service
                Bus (ESB) distributed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html">Apache
                Software License v2.0</a>. WSO2 ESB allows system administrators and developers to
                easily configure message routing, intermediation, transformation, logging, task
                scheduling, fail over routing and load balancing. It also supports transport
                switching, eventing, rule based mediation and priority based mediation for advanced
                integration requirements. The ESB runtime is designed to be completely asynchronous,
                non-blocking and streaming based on the <a href="http://synapse.apache.org">Apache
                Synapse</a> mediation engine.
            </p>

            <p>
                WSO2 ESB 5.0.0 is developed on top of the revolutionary
                <a href="http://wso2.org/projects/carbon">WSO2 Carbon platform</a> (Middleware a' la carte),
                an OSGi based framework that provides seamless modularity to your SOA via
                componentization. This release also contains many new features and a range of optional
                components (add-ons) that can be installed to customize the behavior of the ESB. Further, any
                existing features of the ESB which are not required to your environment can be easily
                removed using the underlying provisioning framework of Carbon. In brief, WSO2 ESB can
                be fully customized and tailored to meet your exact SOA needs.
            </p>
