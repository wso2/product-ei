## Development guidelines

- Create a proxy service with the following configuration. For information on how to create a proxy service, see 
[Creating a Proxy Service](https://docs.wso2.com/display/EI640/Creating+a+Proxy+Service).

```xml
<proxy xmlns="http://ws.apache.org/ns/synapse" name="JMStoHTTPStockQuoteProxy" transports="jms">
       <target>
           <inSequence>
               <property action="set" name="OUT_ONLY" value="true"/>
           </inSequence>
           <endpoint>
