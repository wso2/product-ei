## Business use case narrative

This sub-scenario will be covering how the routing messages will handled with the given XPath by using the mediators.
Routing the messages into the relevant systems based on the requested content can be done by using Switch and Filter mediators.
Xpath and Xpath with namespace related scenarios will be covering in next sub-scenarios sections.
